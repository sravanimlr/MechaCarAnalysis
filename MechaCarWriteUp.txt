MechaCarData Analysis 

Project Overview 
This project was focused on using R coding language to analyze data.
Stastical analysis along with all its components such as t-tests, p values, and linear models were all used. 
The following datasets were used for this project: MechaCarData and SuspensionCoilData. 

Multiple Linear Regression Model 
For this analysis, the MechaCarData was used. 
The multiple linear regression was testing if miles per gallon variable was dependent on the other categories such as vehicle weight or leghth. 
Thus, the null hypothesis would be that mpg is not dependent on the others, and the alternative hypothesis would be that it is. 
After conducting the test, it was found that the p-value is very low, it is safe to say that the hypothesis can be rejected. 
The correlation is not statistically significant. Also, The slope of the linear model is not completely zero. 
The values are very low, but they do not reach zero. If all the factors are analyzed, ground clearance and vehicle lenght provide a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset. 
This is because the t values are low showing that they are significant as opposed to that of other variables.

Summary statistics is a collection of all popular and needed numerical projections such as mean, median, range, and even standard deviation. 
The summary statistics show a mean of 1499 PSI, median of 1500 PSI, and variance of 63 PSI. For this dataset, PSI was the most changing variable, thus it was important to analyze its statistics. 
MecharCar placed importance on the variance not exceeding 100 pounds per inch. The current data does meet this expectation as the variance is about 68 pounds per inch. 

One Sample T-test

One Sample t-test

data:  log10(suspension_data$PSI)
t = -7978095, df = 149, p-value < 0.00000000000000022
alternative hypothesis: true mean is not equal to 1500
95 percent confidence interval:
 3.175361 3.176103
sample estimates:
mean of x 
 3.175732 

A sample t-test uses a set of values and compares these to another sample or its mean.
In this case, the mean was provided to be 1500. This is still working with the PSI data thus we are looking at pounds per inches. 
The t test comparing the sample of values and the mean of another sample showed that there was no statistical significance. 
The t value is negative showing now statistical connection. Thus, the sample and the mean it was compared had no relationship. 
This type of test is useful when a mean value is given and can be compared with.

Design your Study 
It would be interesting to see the correlation between color options and rating of the vehicle. 
The null hypothesis would be color of vehicle and rating have no relation when it comes to vehicle popularity. 
The alternative hypothesis would be that the color does have an effect on the rating of a vehicle and thus, will effect popularity.
For this hypothesis, it will be important to do linear regression along with summary statsitics to get a full analysis of the study. 
Graphs such as bar charts and line charts will help visualize the popularity aspect which will allow for correct analysis to be made to either reject or accept the analysis.
